     <p id="description">The banana is a fruit like none other. It's the world's most consumed fruit and spans generations as a staple food.It's soft, sweet, and easy to digest. It crosses historical eras, has been responsible for entire governments
       rising and falling, and has propped up beleaguered economies. As well as being one of the most popular fruits worldwide, bananas are also one of the most nutritious of all foods. Bananas are a source of energy-producing carbohydrates,
       potassium, vitamin B6 and B group vitams, vitamin C, dietary fibre and antioxidants. Bananas have no fat, cholesterol or salt. Because they provide sustaining energy, bananas are a favorite food for active children and adults, including
       athletes and sports players.
       In many nations, a special variety of bananas are a major staple food crop. Known as Plantains or Cooking Bananas, they are a starchier variety of banana cooked green in ways similar to potatoes.The banana is a superfood that can be used in
       many meals and recipes.</p>
